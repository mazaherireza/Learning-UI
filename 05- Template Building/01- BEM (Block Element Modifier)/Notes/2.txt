Block
-----
Encapsulates a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. 
While blocks can be nested and interact with each other, semantically they remain equal; there is no precedence or hierarchy. 
Holistic entities without DOM representation (such as controllers or models) can be blocks as well.

Naming
Block names may consist of lowercase Latin letters, digits, and dashes. 
To form a CSS class, add a short prefix for namespacing: ".block"
Spaces in long block names are replaced by dash.

Element
-------
Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. Any element is semantically tied to its block.

Naming
Element names may consist of lowercase Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores. 
CSS class is formed as block name plus two underscores plus element name: ".block__elem" 
Spaces in long element names are replaced by dash.

Modifier
--------
Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance, behavior or state. <----------- **

Naming
Modifier names may consist of lowercase Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores. 

CSS class is formed as block's or element's name plus two dashes: 
.block--mod or .block__elem--mod and .block--color-black with .block--color-red. 

Spaces in complicated modifiers are replaced by dash.
