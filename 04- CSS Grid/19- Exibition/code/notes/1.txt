height: 100% gives the element, 100% height of its parent container.
height: auto means the element height will depend upon the height of its children.

fr automatically sets minimums, which respect the content inside. <---------------- ***
So with frs, the minimum is automatic (i.e., auto) 
and the maximum is the value you've set (e.g., 1fr, 2fr, etc.)
You can override the sizing from default to min/max.
