Styling Text
------------
The <em> tag emphasizes text, while the <strong> tag highlights important text.

Browsers, however, have built-in style sheets that will generally style these tags in the following ways:
The <em> tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
The <strong> will generally render as bold emphasis.
