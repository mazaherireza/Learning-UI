Displaying Text
---------------
If you want to display text in HTML, you can use a paragraph or span.

Paragraphs <p> contain a block of plain text.

<span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML.
They are used to seprate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.

<p><span>Self-driving cars</span> are anticipated to replace up to 2 million jobs over the next two decades.</p>

It's best to use a <span> element when you want to target a specific piece of content that is inline,
or on the same line as other text.
If you want to divide your content into blocks, it's better to use a <div>.
