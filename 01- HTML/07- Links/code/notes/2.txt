Opening Links in a New WINDOW
-----------------------------
The target attribute specifies how a link should open.

For a link to open in a new WINDOW, the target attribute requires a value of _blank.

The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, 
just like the href attribute.

The target="_blank" attribute, when used in modern browsers, will open new websites in a new TAB.
