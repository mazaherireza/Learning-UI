Linking to Same Page
--------------------
When users visit our site, 
we want them to be able to click a link and have the page automatically scroll to a specific section. 

In order to link to a target on the same page, we must give the target an id, like this:

<p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
<h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom!</h1>

The target link is a string containing the # character and the target element's id. 

<ol>
  <li><a href="#top">Top</a></li>
  <li><a href="#bottom">Bottom</a></li>
</ol>

In the example above, the links to <p id="top"> and <h1 id="bottom"> are embedded in an ordered list. 
These links appear in the browser as a numbered list of links.
