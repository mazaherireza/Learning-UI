Linking to Other Web Pages
--------------------------
One of the powerful aspects of HTML (and the Internet), is the ability to link to other web pages. 

You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element <a> 
and including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags.

... href attribute.
This attribute stands for hyperlink reference and is used to link to a path, 
or the address to where a file is located (whether it is on your computer or another location).

The paths provided to the href attribute are often URLs.

When reading technical documentation, you may come across the term hyperlink. 
Not to worry, this is simply the technical term for link.
These terms are often used interchangeably.
