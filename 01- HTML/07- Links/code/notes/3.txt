Linking to Relative Page
------------------------
...
Many sites also link to internal web pages like Home, About, and Contact.

When making multi-page static websites, web developers often store HTML files in the root directory, 
or a main folder where all the files for the project are stored.

project-folder/
|____ about.html
|____ contact.html
|____ index.html

If the browser is currently displaying index.html, it also knows that about.html and contact.html are in the same folder.

Because the files are stored in the same folder, we can link web pages together using a relative path.

<a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>

..., the <a> tag is used with a relative path to link from the current HTML file 
to the contact.html file in the same folder. 

A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file (a file on the same website, such as ./index.html) 
versus an absolute path (a full URL, like https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html which is stored in a different folder)

The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder.
