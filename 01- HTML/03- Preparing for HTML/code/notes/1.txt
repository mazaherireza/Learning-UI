Preparing for HTML
------------------
HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly.

You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration. 
The declaration looks like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>

This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document.
It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document.
... the html in <!DOCTYPE html> is referring to HTML5, ...

The <html> Tag
--------------
To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>

Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code.

The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page.
Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page.
Unlike the information inside of the <body> tag, the metadata in the head is information about the page itself. 

A browser's tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. 
The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>.

One of the key HTML elements, we use to build a webpage is the body element.
Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to the screen.
