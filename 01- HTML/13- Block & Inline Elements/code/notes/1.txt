HTML Block and Inline Elements
------------------------------
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
The 2 most common display values are block and inline.

A block-level element always starts on a new line, 
and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

An inline element does not start on a new line.
... only takes up as much width as necessary.

An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
