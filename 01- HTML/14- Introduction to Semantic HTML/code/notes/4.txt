Article and Section
-------------------
<section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, 
or any other area of the document with the same theme.
For example, content with the same theme such as articles about cricket can go under a single <section>. 

A website's home page could be split into sections for the introduction,
news items, and contact information.

Here is an example of how to use <section>:

<section>
  <h2>How to Use Promise</h2> 
</section>

... we created a <section> element to encapsulate the code.

The <article> element holds content that makes sense on its own. 
<article> can hold content such as articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. 

<section>
  <h2>How to Use Promise</h2>
  <article>
    <p>....</p>
    <p>Promise.then() takes 2 arguments, a callback for success and another for failure.</p>
  </article>
</section>

... a <section> element could also be placed in an <article> element depending on the context.
