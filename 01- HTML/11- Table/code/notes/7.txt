Table Body
----------
Over time, a table can grow to contain a lot of data and become very long. 
When this happens, the table can be sectioned off so that it is easier to manage.

Long tables can be sectioned off using the table body element: <tbody>. 
The <tbody> element should contain all of the table's data, excluding the table headings.

Table Head
----------
When a table's body is sectioned off, however, 
it also makes sense to section off the table's headings using the <thead> element.

Table Footer
------------
The bottom part of a long table can also be sectioned off using the <tfoot> element.

Footers are often used to contain sums, differences, and other data results.
