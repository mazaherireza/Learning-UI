Table Data
----------
Rows aren't sufficient to add data to a table. 
Each cell element must also be defined. 

In HTML, you can add data using the table data element: <td>.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Reza</td>
    <td>Mazaheri</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the table were displayed in the browser, it would show a table with one row and two columns.
