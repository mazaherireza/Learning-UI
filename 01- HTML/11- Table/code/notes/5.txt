Table Headings
--------------
Table data doesn't make much sense without titles to describe what the data represents.
To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: <th>.

The table heading element is used just like a table data element, except with a relevant title.
Just like table data, a table heading must be placed within a table row.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Temperature</th>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>

What happened in the code above? 

First, a new row was added to hold the 3 headings: 
a blank heading, a Saturday heading, and a Sunday heading.

In the second row, one table heading was added as a row title: Temperature.

Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values:
1- row: this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
2- col: this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.
