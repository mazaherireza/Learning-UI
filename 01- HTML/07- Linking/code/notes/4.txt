Linking At Will
---------------
You've probably visited websites where not all links were made up of text. 
Maybe the links you clicked on, were images or some other form of content.

Thankfully, HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element.
With this technique, it's possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the <img> element with an <a> element.
