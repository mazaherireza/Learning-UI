Header and Nav
--------------
A <header> is a container usually for either navigational links or introductory content containing <h1> to <h6> headings.

  </h1>
</header>

By using a <header> tag, our code becomes easier to read. 
It is much easier to identify what is inside of the <h1>'s parent tags, 
as opposed to a <div> tag which would provide no details as to what was inside of the tag.

A <nav> is used to define a block of navigation links such as menus and tables of contents. 
It is important to note that <nav> can be used inside of the <header> element but can also be used on its own.

<header> 
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>      
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

By using <nav> as a way to label our navigation links, it will be easier for not only us, 
but also for web browsers and screen readers to read the code.
