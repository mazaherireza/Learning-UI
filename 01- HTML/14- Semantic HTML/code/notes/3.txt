Main and Footer
---------------
These elements along with <nav> and <header> help describe where an element is located 
based on conventional web development standards.

The element <main> is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. 
This tag is separate from the <footer> and the <nav> of a web page 
since these elements don't contain the principal content. 

By using <main> as opposed to a <div> element, 
screen readers and web browsers are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content.

So how does <main> look when incorporated into our code? 

<main>
  <header>
    <h1>Asyncronous Programming in JavaScript<h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <h3>Promise</h3>
    <p>
      Most programs consist of a producing code that performs a time-consuming task and a consuming code 
      that needs the result of the producing code.
      ...
    </p>
  </article>
</main>

..., <main> contains an <article> and <header> tag with child elements 
that hold the most important information related to the page.

The content at the bottom of the subject information is known as the footer, indicated by the <footer> element. 

The footer contains information such as:
Contact information
Copyright information
Terms of use
Site Map
Reference to top of page links

... is separate from the <main> element and typically located at the bottom of the content.
