Text Input
----------
The <input> element has a type attribute which determines 
how it renders on the web page and what kind of data it can accept. 
When we create an <input> element with type="text", it renders a text field that users can type into.

It's also important that we include a name attribute for the <input>.
Without the name attribute, information in the <input> won't be sent when the <form> is submitted. 

<form action="/collection.html" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="first-name" value="Reza" />
</form>

... first-name="Reza" is sent to collection.html ...
