How a Form Works
----------------
We can think of the internet as a network of computers which send and receive information. 

Computers need an HTTP request to know how to communicate.
The HTTP request instructs the receiving computer how to handle the incoming information.

The <form> element is a great tool for collecting information, 
but then we need to send that information somewhere else for processing.

We need to supply the <form> element with both the location of where the <form>'s information goes and 
what HTTP request to make.

<form action="/example.html" method="POST"></form>

... we've created the skeleton for a <form> that will send information to example.html as a POST request.
The action attribute determines where the information is sent 
and the method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.
