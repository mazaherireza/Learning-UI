Introduction to HTML Form Validation
------------------------------------
Validation is the concept of checking user provided data against the required data.

..., we use client-side validation if we want to check the data on the browser (the client). 
This validation occurs before data is sent to the server. 
Different browsers implement client-side validation differently, but it leads to the same outcome.

... the benefits of using HTML5's built-in client-side validation.
It saves us time from having to send information to the server 
and wait for the server to send back confirmation or rejection of the data. 

This can also help us protect our server from malicious code or data from a malicious user.

It also allows us to quickly give feedback to users for specific fields 
rather than having them fill in a form again if the data they input into the form was rejected.
