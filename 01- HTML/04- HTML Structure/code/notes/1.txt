HTML Structure
--------------
HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships.
When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element.
The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.

<body>
  <p>This paragraph is a child of the body</p>
</body>

... 2 spaces of indentation for better readability. 

The relationship between elements and 
their ancestor(forefather) and descendent(generation) elements is known as hierarchy.

Understanding HTML hierarchy is important 
because child elements can inherit behaviour and styling from their parent element.
