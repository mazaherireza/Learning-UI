Attributes
----------
If we want to expand an element's tag, we can do so using an attribute.
Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways, 
from providing information to changing styling.

Attributes are made up of the following 2 parts: 
1- The name of the attribute 
2- The value of the attribute

One commonly used attribute is the id.
