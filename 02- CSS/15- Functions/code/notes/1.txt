CSS Functions
-------------
CSS functions are used as a value for various CSS properties.

The calc() function performs a calculation to be used as the property value.
The following operators can be used: + - * /

The max() function uses the largest value, from a comma-separated list of values, as the property value.

selector {
  width: max(500px, 60%);
}
...

The minmax() CSS function defines a size range greater than or equal to min and less than or equal to max. 
It is used with CSS Grids. <---------------- ***

The clamp() CSS function clamps a middle value within a range of values between a defined minimum bound and a maximum bound. 
The function takes three parameters: 
a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value.

(If you clamp something in a particular place, you hold it there tightly)
