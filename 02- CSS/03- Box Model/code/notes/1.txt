CSS Box Model
-------------
All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.
... a box that wraps around every HTML element.
It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins.

When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area.

The box-sizing property allows us, to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height.
