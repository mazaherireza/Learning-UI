Changing The Box Model
----------------------

Box Model: Content-Box
----------------------
In CSS, the box-sizing property controls the type of box model the browser should use when interpreting a web page. 
The default value of this property is content-box.
This is the same box model that is affected by border thickness and padding.

Box Model: Border-Box
---------------------
In this box model, the height and width of the box will remain fixed. 

The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box, 
which means the overall dimensions of the box do not change.

(The content area is automatically sized based on the remaining width, after border and padding has been subtracted)
