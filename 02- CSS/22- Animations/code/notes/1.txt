CSS Animations
--------------
CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript! <-------------- ***

What are CSS Animations?

An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
To use CSS animation, you MUST first specify some keyframes for the animation. <------------ ***
Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

The @keyframes Rule <--------------------- **
-------------------
When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, 
the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.

To get an animation to work, you MUST bind the animation to an element.

@keyframes something {
  from {}
  to {}
}

/* The element to apply the animation to */
div {
  ...
  animation-name: something;
  animation-dutation: 4s; <---------- defines how long an animation should take to COMPLETE.
}

The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, 
backwards or in alternate cycles.
