in order for that font to display when a user visits the web page.

2- The default typeface for all HTML elements is Times New Roman. <---------- **

3- It's a good practice to limit the number of typefaces used on a web page to 2 or 3. 
This helps the page load faster in some cases and is usually a good design decision.

4- When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, 
it's a best practice to enclose the typeface's name in quotes.
