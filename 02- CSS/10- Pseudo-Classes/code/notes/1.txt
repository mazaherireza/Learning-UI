CSS Pseudo-classes 
------------------
pseudo- (pretended and not real)

... is used to define a special state of an element. <-------------- ***
For example, it can be used to:
Style an element when a user mouses over it    

The :root selector matches the document's root element.
In HTML, the root element is ALWAYS the html element. <-------------- ***

:root {
  CSS declarations;
}

The :empty selector matches every element that has no children (including text nodes). 

The :checked selector, matches every checked <input> element (only for radio buttons and checkboxes) and <option> element.

input[type="checkbox"]:checked + .alert {
  display: inline-block;
}

The :not(selector) selector, matches every element that is NOT the specified element/selector.
