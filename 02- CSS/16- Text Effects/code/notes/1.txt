CSS Text Effects
----------------
The CSS text-overflow property specifies how overflowed content that is not displayed, should be signaled to the user.
It can be clipped, or it can be rendered as an ellipsis (...). 

The CSS word-wrap property allows long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next line. 
If a word is too long to fit within an area, it expands outside,
The word-wrap property allows you to force the text to wrap, even if it means splitting it in the middle of a word.

The CSS writing-mode property specifies whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically.

The white-space property specifies how white-space inside an element is handled.
