Typography
----------
The art of arranging text on a page. <---------- *

Font Family
-----------
The phrase "type of font" refers to the technical term typeface, or font family.

To change the typeface of text on your web page, you can use the font-family property.

Web Safe Fonts
--------------
There is a selection of fonts that will appear the same, across all browsers and operating systems. <-------- *
These fonts are referred to as web safe fonts. 
You can check out a complete list of web safe fonts here.

Fallback Fonts and Font Stacks
------------------------------
Web safe fonts are good fallback fonts that can be used if your preferred font, is not available.

h1 {
  font-family: Caslon, Georgia, 'Times New Roman';
}

Georgia and Times New Roman are fallback fonts to Caslon. 

When you specify a group of fonts, you have what is known as a font stack. <--------- **
A font stack usually contains a list of similar-looking fonts. 

Serif and Sans-Serif
--------------------
Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter, as opposed to Sans-Serif fonts, 
which do not have the extra details.

serif and sans-serif are also keyword values that can be added as a final fallback font if nothing else in the font stack is available.

h1 {
  font-family: Caslon, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;
}

... the font stack has 4 fonts. <------------ *
If the first 3 fonts aren’t available, the browser will use whatever serif font is available on the system.

Font Weight
-----------
font-weight property controls how bold or thin text appears. 
It can be specified with keywords or numerical values.

...
bolder: One font weight bolder than the element's parent value <--------------- *

Numerical values can range from 1 (lightest) to 1000 (boldest), but it is common practice to use increments of 100. 
(Valid values are multiples of 100 within this range)

A font weight of 400 is equal to the keyword value normal, and a font weight of 700 is equal to bold.

... not all fonts can be assigned a numeric font weight,
and not all numeric font weights are available to all fonts. <---------------- **
It’s a good practice to look up the font you are using to see which font-weight values are available.

Font Style
----------
You can also italicize text with the font-style property.

Word Spacing
------------
You can also increase the spacing between words in a body of text, technically known as word spacing.
To do so, you can use the word-spacing property.

The default amount of space between words is usually 0.25em. 

Letter Spacing
--------------
The technical term for adjusting the spacing between letters is called "kerning". <-------------- **

Text Transformation
-------------------

Text Alignment
--------------

Line Height
-----------
... to set how tall we want the line containing our text to be, regardless of the height of the text.
Line heights can take one of several values:

1. A unitless number, such as 1.2. 
This number is an absolute value that will compute the line height as a ratio of the font size. <------------ **

2. A number specified by unit, such as 12px. 
This number can be any valid CSS unit, such as pixels, percents, ems, or rems. 

Generally, the unitless ratio value is the preferred method, <-------------- **
since it is responsive and based exclusively on the current font size.
