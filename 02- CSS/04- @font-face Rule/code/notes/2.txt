Fallback Fonts
--------------
Most computers have a small set of typefaces pre-installed. 
This small set includes serif fonts like Times New Roman and sans-serif fonts like Arial.
These pre-installed fonts serve as fallback fonts if the stylesheet specifies a font which is not installed on a user's computer. 

Fallback fonts help ensure a consistent experience for the diverse audience of users that visit a site.

Linking Fonts 1
---------------
...
New fonts are often centralized in directories made available for public use. 
We refer to these fonts as non-user fonts. 

Google Fonts is one such directory of thousands of open-source fonts, available for free use.

<link>    @import

Embed code in the <head> of your html
...

Roboto: CSS class
...

Linking Fonts 2
---------------
When we have the link to the font of our choice, we can add the font to the <head> section of the HTML document, 
using the <link> tag and the href. 
...
Once a font is linked, we can create CSS selectors to target elements, just as we do with other fonts.

Font-Face 1
-----------
There are other ways to link non-user fonts that don't require the use of the <link> tag in the HTML document.

CSS offers a way to import fonts directly into stylesheets with the @font-face property. <------------ **
To load fonts with the @font-face property:

1. Instead of using the font's link in the HTML document, enter the link into the URL bar in the browser. 
2. The browser will load the CSS rules. 

You will need to focus on the rules that are directly labeled as /* latin */. <-------------- **
Some of the latin rules are on separate lines. 
You will need each of these.

3. Copy each of the CSS rules labeled latin, and paste the rules from the browser to the top of style.css.
... copy the @font-face rules to the top of the stylesheet for the font to load correctly in the project. <------- **

Font-Face 2
-----------
We can then use the fonts in the stylesheets as you would use any other font.

Font-Face 3
-----------
... using a font from an external service.  

We can modify our @font-face rule, to use local font files as well. 
We can supply the user with the desired font family and host it along with our site instead of depending on a different site.

@font-face {
  font-family: "Roboto";
  src: url(fonts/Roboto.woff2) format('woff2'),
    url(fonts/Roboto.woff) format('woff'),
    url(fonts/Roboto.tff) format('truetype');
}

We add a format for each file to specify which font to use. 
Different browsers support different font types, so providing multiple font file options will support more browsers. 

... .woff2 appears to be the way of the future, due to greatly reduced file sizes and improved performance, 
but many browsers still don't support it.

@font-face ruleset 
...
..., fonts can be downloaded just like any other file on the web.
They come in a few different file formats, such as:

OTF (OpenType Font)
TTF (TrueType Font)
WOFF (Web Open Font Format)
WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format 2)

Itâ€™s a good idea to include TTF, WOFF, and WOFF2 formats with your @font-face rule to ensure compatibility on all browsers.

The @font-face at-rule is used as the selector. <----------------- **
Once the @font-face at-rule is defined, you can use the font in your stylesheet!
