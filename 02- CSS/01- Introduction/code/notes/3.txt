Selectors
---------
...
How do you decide which elements will get the style? 
With a selector.

A selector is used to target the specific HTML element(s) to be styled by the declaration. 

Type 
----
... the type selector, matches the type of the element in the HTML document.

p {  
  color: blue;
}

This is an instance of using the type selector.
... the type selector is sometimes referred to as the tag name or element selector.

Universal
---------
The universal selector, selects all elements of any type.
... such as resetting default browser styling, or selecting all children of a parent element.

Class
-----
... a period (.) must be prepended to the class's name. 

Multiple Classes
----------------

ID
--
...
In contrast to class which accepts multiple values, and can be used broadly throughout an HTML document,
an element's id can only have a single value, <------------------- ***
and only be used once per page.

... we prepend the id name with a number sign (#). 

Attribute
---------
... some HTML elements use attributes to add extra detail or functionality to the element. 

The attribute selector can be used to target HTML elements that already contain attributes. 

Elements of the same type can be targeted differently by their attribute or attribute value. 
This alleviates the need to add new code, like the class or id attributes.

[href] {
  color: magenta;
}

The most basic syntax is an attribute surrounded by square brackets. <------------- **
In the above example: 
[href] would target all elements with an href attribute and set the color to magenta.

And it can get more granular from there, by adding type and/or attribute values. 
One way is by using type [attribute*=value].
...

Pseudo-class
------------
You may have observed how the appearance of certain elements can change, 
or be in a different state, after certain user interactions. 

... :focus, :visited, :disabled, and :active are all pseudo-classes.

Factors such as user interaction, site navigation, 
and position in the DOM can all give elements a different state with pseudo-class.

A pseudo-class can be attached to any selector. <--------------- **
It is always written as a colon : followed by a name. 

p:hover {

}

Classes and IDs
---------------

Specificity
-----------
Specificity is the order by which, the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed. 
...
Which style will win the "specificity war"? 

Chaining
--------
When writing CSS rules, itâ€™s possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.
This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. 

Descendant Combinator
---------------------
CSS also supports selecting elements that are nested within other HTML elements, also known as descendants. 

.list li {
    
}
