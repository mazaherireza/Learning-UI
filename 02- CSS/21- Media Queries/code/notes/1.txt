CSS Media Queries 
-----------------
The @media rule, made it possible to define different STYLE RULES for different media types. 

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
width and height of the viewport
orientation of the viewport (landscape or portrait)
resolution

Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, 
and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).

Media Query Syntax
------------------
A media query consists of a media type and can contain one or more media features, which resolve to either true or false.

@media not|only mediatype and (media feature) and (media feature) {
  CSS-Code;
}

The mediatype is optional (if omitted, it will be set to all). <--------------------- ***
However, if you use not or only, you MUST also specify a mediatype.

The result of the query is true if the specified media type matches the type of device 
the document is being displayed on and ALL media features in the media query are true.

When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules.

Meaning of the not, only, and and keywords:
not: This keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query. <------------------- ***

only: This keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries from applying the specified styles. 
It has no effect on modern browsers.

and: This keyword combines a media type and one or more media features.

You can also link to different stylesheets for different media and different widths of the browser window (viewport):
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 701px) and (max-width: 900px)" href="something.css">
