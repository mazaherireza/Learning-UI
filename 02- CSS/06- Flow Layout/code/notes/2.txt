Introduction to Color
---------------------
Using a numeric system, allows us to take advantage of the whole spectrum of colors that browsers support.

Colors in CSS can be described in 3 different ways:
Named colors: English words that describe colors, also called keyword colors. <------------- **
RGB: numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue.
HSL: numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness

Hexadecimal
-----------
...
Colors specified using this system are called hex colors. <--------------- **

A hex color begins with a hash character (#) which is followed by 3 or 6 characters. 
The characters represent values for red, green and blue.

white: #FFFFFF or #FFF

RGB Colors
----------
There is another syntax for representing RGB values that uses decimal numbers.
...

h1 {
  color: rgb(23, 45, 23);
}

Here, each of the 3 values represents a color component, and each can have a decimal number value from 0 to 255.

... it's good to choose one and be consistent throughout your CSS, because it's easier to compare hex to hex and decimal to decimal.

The RGB color scheme is convenient because it's very close to how computers represent colors internally. <--------- *

Hex and RGB
-----------
The hexadecimal and RGB color system, can represent many more colors than the small set of CSS named colors.

256 * 256 * 256 
Compare that to the 147 named CSS colors.

Hue, Saturation, and Lightness
------------------------------
There's another equally powerful system in CSS called the hue-saturation-lightness color scheme, abbreviated as HSL.

The first number represents the degree of the hue, and can be between 0 and 360. 
The second and third numbers are percentages representing saturation and lightness respectively.

color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);

Hue ...
It refers to an angle on a color wheel. 
Red is 0 degrees, Green is 120 degrees, Blue is 240 degrees, and then back to Red at 360.

Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the color.

Lightness refers to how light or dark the color is. 
Halfway, or 50%, is normal lightness. <-------------------- **

HSL is convenient for adjusting colors. 
In RGB, making the color a little darker may affect all 3 color components.
In HSL, that's as easy as changing the lightness value.

Opacity and Alpha
-----------------
...
color: hsla(34, 100%, 50%, 0.1);

The fourth value is the alpha. 
This last value is sometimes called the opacity.

Alpha is a decimal number from zero to one. <------------ *

If alpha is zero, the color will be completely transparent. 

You can think of the alpha value as, "the amount of the background to mix with the foreground".

The RGB color scheme has a similar syntax for opacity, rgba color: 
rgba(234, 45, 98, 0.33);

Alpha can only be used with HSL and RGB colors; 
we cannot add the alpha value to color: green, color: #FFFFF. 

There is, however, a named color keyword for zero opacity, transparent. <----------------- **
It's equivalent to rgba(0, 0, 0, 0). 
It's used like any other color keyword:
color: transparent;
